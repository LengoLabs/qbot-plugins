This command will allow you to page a role/roles. Setting it up is pretty easy. Copying the pager.ts file. Then make a new file in src/commands/admin,
name that file pager.ts and paste the code. You will have to look through it and add the role id, channel id, and the description.

If you have any issues please let me know.
Enjoy :D
