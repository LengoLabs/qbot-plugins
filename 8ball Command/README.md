# 8ball Command
This plugin will add a magic 8 ball command.

## Setup
* Copy the contents of the `8ball.ts` file into a new file with this path in your bot: `src/commands/information/8ball.ts`.

* If you found some bug let me know it.

## If you want to change the answers read this.
* To change/add answers go to `8ball.ts` then go to where it says `const answer = ` and in the [] you can change the answers.
* Template of adding them `['text1', 'text2', 'text3']` and etc.

* Iâ€™m gessing you know this but where it says text here that is where you put your answers.
